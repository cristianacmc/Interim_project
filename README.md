# Data Analyst Program - Interim Project 

### The AdventureWorks demo database serves as a great platform to practice SQL and data analytics skills. In this project, We are working as a team to answer a set of questions using the AdventureWorks dataset, a demo dataset maintained by Microsoft.<br><br>

### Team: Nonty, Nina, Hazel, Cristiana and  Cian<br><br>

## Project Instructions and Deliverables

1.	What are the regional sales in the best performing country?

2.	What is the relationship between annual leave taken and bonus?

3.	What is the relationship between Country and Revenue?

4.	What is the relationship between sick leave and Job Title?

5.	What is the relationship between store trading duration and revenue?

6.	What is the relationship between the size of the stores, number of employees and revenue?
<br><br>

### Question 1 - What are the regional sales in the best performing country?
<hr/>
<p>To tackel this question, I followed these steps:<br>

* On SSMS I created a view as below:
 ```
	SELECT st.[CountryRegionCode] AS CountryCode<br>
		   ,pr.[Name] AS CountryName<br>
		   ,st.[Name] AS Region<br>
		   ,CAST(SUM(sh.SubTotal) AS INT) AS TotalSales<br>
		  FROM [AdventureWorks2019].[Sales].[SalesTerritory] AS st<br>
		  LEFT JOIN [AdventureWorks2019].[Sales].[SalesOrderHeader] AS sh<br>
			 ON st.TerritoryID = sh.TerritoryID<br>
		  LEFT JOIN [AdventureWorks2019].[Person].[CountryRegion] pr<br>
			 ON st.CountryRegionCode = pr.CountryRegionCode<br>
		  WHERE sh.OrderDate BETWEEN '2013-01-01' AND '2013-12-31'<br>
		  GROUP BY st.[TerritoryID], st.[CountryRegionCode], st.Name, st.[Group], pr.Name
```


* In order to find the best performing country, I used the pandas iloc function to select the first row and 
<em>CountryCode</em> column and stored the result on <em>k_region</em> variable
* Then I subset the dataframe column <em>CountryCode</em> with <em>k_region</em> variable to filter only the regions that belongs to the most performing country 

<p> To start off the project, we are setting up a connection to my SQL Server instance and database. Here this is a Trusted Connection and does not require login details</p>

```
# Importing the required libaries
import pyodbc
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

conn = pyodbc.connect('Driver={SQL Server};'
                      'Server=DESKTOP-J5R1BFO;'
                      'Database=AdventureWorks2019;'
                      'Trusted_Connection=yes;')
```

<p>Now that I have a connection, we are using the read_sql_query method to create a dataframe from the server connection. 
</p>

```
# read the querie and create a new dataframe object 
# ordered the TotalSales column within Pandas
df1 = pd.read_sql_query('SELECT * FROM SalesRegionV ORDER BY TotalSales DESC', conn)

# print the head of the dataframe object
print(df1)
```

 import numpy as np
# select US on CountryCode column and TotalSales in US
us_x = df1.iloc[0, 0]
us_bool = df1['CountryCode'] == us_x
df_us = df1[us_bool]
us_total = np.array(df_us['TotalSales'])
us_regions = np.array(df_us['Region'])


# select CA on CountryCode column and TotalSales in CA
ca_x = df1.iloc[1, 0]
ca_bool = df1['CountryCode'] == ca_x
df_ca = df1[ca_bool]
ca_total = df_ca['TotalSales']

# select AU on CountryCode column and TotalSales in AU
au_x = df1.iloc[3, 0]
au_bool = df1['CountryCode'] == au_x
df_au = df1[au_bool]
au_total = df_au['TotalSales']

# select FR on CountryCode column and TotalSales in FR
fr_x = df1.iloc[4, 0]
fr_bool = df1['CountryCode'] == fr_x
df_fr = df1[fr_bool]
fr_total = np.array(df_fr['TotalSales'])

# select GB on CountryCode column and TotalSales in GB
gb_x = df1.iloc[5, 0]
gb_bool = df1['CountryCode'] == gb_x
df_gb = df1[gb_bool]
gb_total = df_gb['TotalSales']

# select DE on CountryCode column and TotalSales in DE
de_x = df1.iloc[8, 0]
de_bool = df1['CountryCode'] == de_x
df_de = df1[de_bool]
de_total = df_de['TotalSales']

```

 ![](Q1chart_1.png)

  <p> As the table was ordered in descending order, the country with the best sales performance went to the top row, that is the <strong>United States</strong>.<br>
Then I used slicing with the iloc function to select the indice of the first row and column of the dataframe which is the <em>CountryCode</em>.<br>
<p>With the best performing country stored in the variable <em>K_region</em>, I used the slicing again to subset the <em>CountryCode</em> column with the <em>K_region</em> boolean values and stored the result in the <strong>USregions</strong> variable.<br>
<p>Then I created a dataframe <strong>df_r</strong> with all the regions that contain <strong>US</strong> as country code.</pr>

```
# select the first row on CountryCode column 
k_region = df.iloc[0, 0]
# subset the dataframe with the boolean result in k_region
USregions = df['CountryCode'] ==k_region
df_r = df[USregions]
print(df_r)
```

 ![](q1_table2.png)

 <p>Then I created the the variables <em>regional</em> and <em>total</em> to extract the values fron the <em>df_r</em> dataframe to use on the bar plot</p>

```
# creating the variable region for the Region values
us_region = df_r.iloc[:, 2]
# creating the variable total for the TotalSales values
total = df_r.iloc[:, 3]
```


```
# create the plot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.ticklabel_format(style='plain')
# mixing two styles
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
plt.bar(us_region, total, width=0.6, color=['#004c6d', '#346888', '#5886a5', '#7aa6c2', '#9dc6e0'])
plt.title("REGIONAL SALES IN THE BEST PERFORMING COUNTRY", fontsize= 22, fontweight='bold')
plt.ylabel("Total Sales")
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (9,7)
plt.show()
```

### Question 2 - What is the relationship between annual leave taken and bonus?

<hr/>
<p>The process of answering the question was completed as follows:<br>

* The columns to be analysed were found and because they were from different tables, a query was made using a join with a following query:

    select h.BusinessEntityID, h.VacationHours, s.Bonus<br>
    from HumanResources.Employee as h<br>
    join Sales.SalesPerson as s<br>
    on h.BusinessEntityID = s.BusinessEntityID<br>

* Then I created a new dataframe object from the querie

```
# selecting the query result in df2 variable
df2 = pd.read_sql_query('SELECT * FROM AnnualLeave_bonnusV', conn)

# print the head of the dataframe object
print(df2)
```

![](q2_table1.png)
<br>

```
# scatter plot
import seaborn as sns
df2.plot.scatter(x = 'VacationHours', y = 'Bonus', alpha=0.8)
plt.title('Relationship between Annual Leave and Bonus')
plt.xlabel('Annual Leave')
plt.ylabel('Bonus in £s')
plt.savefig('Q2scatter.png', dpi=300)
plt.show()
```

![](Q2_chart1.png)

```
# plotting the relationship between vacation hours and bonus
x = df2['VacationHours']
y = df2['Bonus']
graph = sns.regplot(x, y)
graph.set_xlabel('Annual Leave', size = 12 )
graph.set_ylabel('Bonus in £s', size = 12 )
graph.set_title('Relationship between Annual Leave and Bonus', size = 12 )
plt.savefig('Q2regr.png', dpi=300)
```
![](Q2_chart2.png)
<br><br>

### Question 3 - What is the relationship between Country and Revenue?

<hr/>

* First I created the below query on SSMS to find out the annual revenue total for each country in all stores<br>
```
SELECT SUM(d.AnnualRevenue) AS Annual_Revenue,<br>
       a.CountryRegionName<br>
FROM Sales.vStoreWithAddresses AS a<br>
INNER JOIN Sales.vStoreWithDemographics AS d<br>
 ON a.BusinessEntityID = d.BusinessEntityID<br>
GROUP BY CountryRegionName<br>
```
* Then I created a new dataframe object from the querie

```
# This will read the view and create a new dataframe object from the query results.
df3 = pd.read_sql_query('SELECT * FROM AnnualRevenue_Country ORDER BY Annual_Revenue DESC', conn)

# Now I want to print the head of my dataframe object
df3.head()
```
![](q3_table1.png)

<p> Then I created a new query to select the store in each country with the highest annual revenue <p> 

```
SELECT a.Name, 
       MAX(AnnualRevenue) AS Revenue, 
       CountryRegionName 
FROM Sales.vStoreWithAddresses AS a
INNER JOIN Sales.vStoreWithDemographics AS d
ON a.BusinessEntityID = d.BusinessEntityID
/** the where clause compares all stores in each country to one store that generated the most revenue**/
WHERE CountryRegionName = 'United Kingdom'
GROUP BY CountryRegionName, a.Name, AnnualRevenue
ORDER BY CountryRegionName, AnnualRevenue DESC;
```
![](q3_table2.png)


<p> Then I created a query to find out the numbers of stores in each country</p>

```
SELECT CountryRegionName,<br>
       COUNT(Name) AS Store<br>
FROM Sales.vStoreWithAddresses<br>
GROUP BY CountryRegionName;<br>
```
<br><br>
### Question 4 - What is the relationship between sick leave and Job Title?

<hr/>

```
query = """
SELECT e.BusinessEntityID AS id
      ,e.JobTitle AS job_title
      ,d.Name AS job_department
      ,d.GroupName AS department_category
      ,CAST(e.OrganizationNode AS varchar(100)) AS organisation_node
      ,e.OrganizationLevel AS organisation_level
      ,e.SickLeaveHours AS sick_leave_hours
  FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e
  JOIN HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory AS edh
       ON e.BusinessEntityID = edh.BusinessEntityID
  JOIN HumanResources.Department AS d
       ON edh.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
 WHERE edh.EndDate IS NULL
"""
df4 = pd.read_sql(query, conn)
df4.head()
```
![](q4_table1.png)

### Data Understanding
Check DataFrame shape
```
df4.shape
```
(290, 7)

Generate an overview of the dataframe
```
df4.info()
```
![](q4_table2.png)

df.describe().round(1)

![](q4_table3.png)

df4.describe(include="object")

![](q4_table4.png)

```
# check for null values
na_in_columns = df4.isna().sum()

if na_in_columns.sum() > 0:
    print(f"NA count: {na_in_columns.sum()}")

    columns_with_na = df4.columns[na_in_columns == 1]
    print(f"Column(s) containing NA: {', '.join(columns_with_na)}")
else:
    print("No NA values")
```
NA count: 2
Column(s) containing NA: organisation_node, organisation_level

```
# check for duplicate values in id column, which should be unique
print(f"Duplicate row count: {df4.duplicated(subset='id').sum()}")
```
Duplicate row count: 0

### Observations:

1. 290 non-duplicate records containing 67 unique job titles in 16 departments across 6 categories
2. Columns **id**, **job_title**, **job_department**, **department_category**, and **organisation_level** contain categorical data
3. Column **sick_leave_hours** contains numerical data
4. Column **organisation_node** contains hierarchical information
5. Columns **organisation_node** and **organisation_level** contain NULL values

### Data Preparation
NULL value in organisation_level is CEO. 
- Level 1 Employees answer directly to CEO
- Level 2 employees answer to Level 1 employees
- Level 3 to Level 2
- Level 4 to Level 3 

Reversing the pattern, it makes sense to consider the CEO a Level 0 employee.
We are not performing an analysis that uses organisation_node, so the NULL value there is ignored.

```
df4["organisation_level"] = df4["organisation_level"].fillna(0).apply(int)
```

**id**, **job_title**, **job_department**, **department_category**, and **organisation_level** contain categorical data and should be stored using the pd.Categorical data type.

```
to_convert = ["id", "job_title", "job_department", "department_category", 'organisation_level']
df4[to_convert] = df4[to_convert].astype("category")
```

### How is sick leave distributed?

```
import seaborn as sns

job_count = df4.groupby("job_title", as_index=False).agg({"id": "count"})

unique_job_count = job_count.shape[0]
print(f"There are {unique_job_count} unique jobs at AdventureWorks")

one_person_roles = (job_count["id"] == 1).sum()
one_person_percent = int(round(100 * (one_person_roles / unique_job_count)))
print(
    f"Of those, {one_person_roles} are job titles held by only one person ({one_person_percent}%)"
)

five_or_more = (job_count["id"] >= 5).sum()
five_plus_percent = int(round(100 * (five_or_more / unique_job_count)))
print(
    f"There are only {five_or_more} job titles held by five or more people ({five_plus_percent}%)"
)
```

There are 67 unique jobs at AdventureWorks
Of those, 28 are job titles held by only one person (42%)
There are only 10 job titles held by five or more people (15%)

### Observations:
* 42% of jobs have only a single employee in the role
* Only 15% of job titles have five or more people in that role


Analysis by job title is unfortunately too granular to provide useful insights, and so we have to find another way to produce results. Two options present themselves: analysis by Organisation Level and analysis by Job Department / Department Category

### How is Sick Leave related to Organisation Level?

During data preparation, the CEO was defined to have Organisation Level 0. Level 1 employees answer directly to the CEO, Level 2 employees answer to Level 1, and so on.
```
(
    df4.groupby("organisation_level")
    .agg({"sick_leave_hours": [np.mean, np.std, np.median, "count"]})
    .round(1)

### Observations:

* CEO has significantly higher sick leave than other employees
* Mean and Median sick leave peak in Level 3 employees and decrease as level increases: higher responsibility employees are afforded less sick leave
* No employee has fewer than 20 hours annual sick leave

### How is Sick Leave related to Department Category?

Each of the 67 unique jobs in AdventureWorks belongs to one of 16 job departments, which in turn belong to one of 6 department categories. We first investigate the relationship between sick leave and department category, then sick leave and job department.
```
group_order = (

<br><br>

### Question 5 - What is the relationship between store trading duration and revenue?

<hr/>

<p>To answer this question regarding the data from AdventureWorks2019, we must consider which data we need to import into the Jupyter Notebook to visualise with Python. The relevant data to answer this question is 'YearOpened' and 'AnnualRevenue', both of which can be found in the view 'Sales.vStoreWithDemographics'</p>

```
df5 = pd.read_sql_query('SELECT * FROM Sales.vStoreWithDemographics', conn) 
```

<p>It is now time to visualise the data: something important to note when looking through the view on SQLServer is that a lot of the data contains the exact same values, thus it is a good idea to make use of the matploblib feature 'alpha', which allows for a transparency factor to be added to each datapoint.</p>

```
plt.style.use('seaborn')
plt.tight_layout()
df5.plot.scatter(x='YearOpened',y='AnnualRevenue',s=40,c='green', edgecolor='black', linewidth=1, alpha=0.1) 
```

![](Q5_chart.png)

<p>As we can see from the scatter plot above showing the data of annual revenue for each store against the year that each store opened, there is no direct correlation between the two. Stores that have opened recently can achieve high values of revenue and vice versa, this is found similarly with stores opened decades ago.</p>

```
correlation = df.corr()
print(correlation)
```

Above we can see the correlation values for each relationship in our dataframe. For year opened and annual revenue, we can see the correlation is very low (0.133635) unlike some other metrics such as sq footage of the store and it's annual revenue which is highly correlated with a value of 0.996531.

### Question 6 - What is the relationship between store size, number of employees and revenue?
<hr/>
<p>To answer this question regarding the data from AdventureWorks2019, we must consider which data we need to import into the Jupyter Notebook to visualise with Python. The relevant data to answer this question is 'YearOpened' and 'AnnualRevenue', both of which can be found in the view 'Sales.vStoreWithDemographics'</p>

```
from matplotlib.colors import LinearSegmentedColormap
rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (7, 7) # default plot size
sns.set_context("talk") # default label size etc.
```
Connect to AdventureWorks database & retrieve data

```
query = """
SELECT BusinessEntityID AS id
      ,AnnualRevenue AS annual_revenue
      ,SquareFeet AS square_footage
      ,NumberEmployees AS employee_count
  FROM Sales.vStoreWithDemographics
"""
store = pd.read_sql(query, conn)
store.head()
```

### Data Understanding
Check DataFrame shape
```
store.shape
```
(701, 4)

Generate an overview of the dataframe
```
store.info()
```
![](q6_table2.png)

```
store.describe().round(1)
```
![](q6_table3.png)
```
store.nunique()
```
![](q6_table4.png)

Check for null values
```
na_in_columns = store.isna().sum()

if na_in_columns.sum() > 0:
    print(f"NA count: {na_in_columns.sum()}")

    columns_with_na = store.columns[na_in_columns == 1]
    print(f"Column(s) containing NA: {', '.join(columns_with_na)}")
else:
    print("No NA values")
```
No NA values

Check for duplicate values in id column, which should be unique
```
print(f"Duplicate row count: {store.duplicated(subset='id').sum()}")
```
Duplicate row count: 0

### Observations:

* Very small number of possible values for **annual_revenue** due to AdventureWorks being a generated database. Revenue is technically continuous data, so will be treated as such for this analysis

### Data Preparation

**id** is categorical rather than numerical data
```
store['id'] = store['id'].astype("category")
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Pairwise relationships between variables
```
sns.pairplot(
    data=store,
    corner=True,
    height=4,
    aspect=1
)
```

correlation = store.corr()

### Observations:

* Almost perfect positive linear correlations between all three variables, meaning if we know any of the three we can make accurate predications about the other two
* **Do not assume correlation means causation**
